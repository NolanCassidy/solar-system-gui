**Solar System Simulation**

Visual representation of the planets in our solar system rotating around the sun
based of the actual mass and velocity of each.

**Tech/framework used**

>   **Built with**

-   Python

-   Tk

-   Jupyter notebook

**Features**

-   Accounts for actual mass, gravity, and velocity of the planets

    -   When changing these values the planets will shoot off course

-   GUI interface for visual representation

-   Choose the time frame of the simulation

-   Choose how many planets to display

**Important Files**

gui.ipynb - This is where you will find the code.

**Installation**

Install Jupyter notebook or copy the code into a separate python file.

**How to use?**

Run the cell block containing various segments of code.

Each cell opens a gui with options to choose time and count of planets.

Inside ‘solarsystem.txt’ you can edit the planet characteristics like mass to
see what would happen if this were the case in real life based off of physics.
